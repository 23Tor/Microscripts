# Microscripts
These are some of my micro level, quality of life scripts I use on the daily/weekly. They're tailored to my specific useage and I whip them up kind of quickly, but hopefully someone finds them useful.

## Loginator
A .tsv file is generated every hour, so this concatenates them into one big text file. Set the input and output folder and run.

## pdfinator
My company uses Nitro to convert images into pdf files, but it's slow and crashes with large loads. This takes the most common file types we see and converts them into pdf pretty quickly.
